        <h1>Who is horus and what is he known for ?</h1>
        <p>
            What is Horus the god of? Horus was the Egyptian sky god and a pharaoh of Egypt. He was the only child of
            Osiris and Isis, two central deities in the Egyptian pantheon. He would avenge the death of his father and
            become a pharaoh of Egypt.

            While Horus won the throne of Egypt, Set mutilated his nephew's eye. The "Eye of Horus" is a famous symbol
            in cultures around the world that pays homage to this cosmic deity.

            Horus is closely associated with falcons and two of his bodily forms are focused on the bird. This sky god
            has other physical representations as well. These details will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs.

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
            Since Horus was said to be the sky, he was considered to also contain the Sun and Moon.[18] Egyptians
            believed that the Sun was his right eye and the Moon his left and that they traversed the sky when he, a
            falcon, flew across it.[19] Later, the reason that the Moon was not as bright as the sun was explained by a
            tale, known as The Contendings of Horus and Seth. In this tale, it was said that Seth, the patron of Upper
            Egypt, and Horus, the patron of Lower Egypt, had battled for Egypt brutally, with neither side victorious,
            until eventually, the gods sided with Horus.

            As Horus was the ultimate victor he became known as ḥr.w or "Horus the Great", but more usually translated
            as "Horus the Elder". In the struggle, Set had lost a testicle, and Horus' eye was gouged out.

            Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a lotus with his
            mother. In the form of a youth, Horus was referred to as nfr ḥr.w "Good Horus", transliterated Neferhor,
            Nephoros or Nopheros (reconstructed as naːfiru ħaːruw).

            The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection and royal power from deities, in this case from
            Horus or Ra. The symbol is seen on images of Horus' mother, Isis, and on other deities associated with her.
            In the Egyptian language, the word for this symbol was "wedjat" (wɟt).[20][21] It was the eye of one of the
            earliest Egyptian deities, Wadjet, who later became associated with Bastet, Mut, and Hathor as well. Wadjet
            was a solar deity and this symbol began as her all-seeing eye. In early artwork, Hathor is also depicted
            with this eye.[22] Funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus. The Wedjat or Eye of
            Horus is "the central element" of seven "gold, faience, carnelian and lapis lazuli" bracelets found on the
            mummy of Shoshenq II.[23] The Wedjat "was intended to protect the king [here] in the afterlife"[23] and to
            ward off evil. Egyptian and Near Eastern sailors would frequently paint the symbol on the bow of their
            vessel to ensure safe sea travel.[24]
